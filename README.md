📄 Project Title: File Handling Operations in C
💻 Platform Used: Dev C++
🎓 Learning Sources: YouTube, GeeksforGeeks, ChatGPT
🧾 Description:
This C program demonstrates basic file handling operations using standard input/output functions and file pointers. The goal is to create a text file, write content into it, append additional content, and finally read and display its contents.

🔍 Key Features:
Create and Open a File (w mode)

Creates a new file named myfile.txt or overwrites an existing one.

Writes user-inputted content into the file.

Append to the File (a mode)

Opens the existing file in append mode.

Adds new content to the end of the file without deleting previous content.

Read and Display File Content (r mode)

Opens the file in read mode.

Displays the full content of the file line by line using fgets().

Error Handling:

Proper checks are in place to ensure the file was created or opened successfully before any read/write operation.

✅ Concepts Practiced:
File handling in C (fopen, fputs, fgets, fclose)

Use of different file modes: write (w), append (a), and read (r)

Buffer usage for reading and writing strings

Basic I/O operations and conditional checks

💡 Learning Outcome:
This task helped solidify my understanding of file operations in C, which are foundational for handling data persistence, log files, or interacting with the filesystem in real-world applications.
